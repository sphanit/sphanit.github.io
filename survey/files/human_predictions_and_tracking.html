						<td>A real-time Deep Learning based method for Pedestrian

The pedestrian detector combines the Aggregate Channel Features (ACF) 
detector with a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in order to 
obtain fast and accurate performance. Our solution is Ô¨Årstly evaluated 
using a set of real images taken from onboard and offboard cameras and, 
then, it is validated in a typical robot navigation environment with 
pedestrians (two distinct experiments are conducted). The results on 
both tests show that our pedestrian detector is robust and fast enough 
to be used on robot navigation applications.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Pedestrians follow different trajectories to avoid obstacles 
and accommodate fellow pedestrians. Any autonomous vehicle navigating 
such a scene should be able to foresee the future positions of 
pedestrians and accordingly adjust its path to avoid collisions. This 
problem of trajectory prediction can be viewed as a sequence generation 
task, where we are interested in predicting the future trajectory of 
people based on their past positions. Following the recent success of 
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models for sequence prediction tasks, we 
propose an LSTM model which can learn general human movement and predict
 their future trajectories. This is in contrast to traditional 
approaches which use hand-crafted functions such as Social Forces. We 
demonstrate the performance of our method on several public datasets. 
Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on some of these 
datasets. We also analyze the trajectories predicted by our model to 
demonstrate the motion behavior learned by our model. Moreover, we 
introduce a new characterization that describes the ‚Äúsocial sensitivity‚Äù
 at which two targets interact. We use this characterization to define 
‚Äúnavigation styles‚Äù and improve both forecasting models and 
state-of-the-art multi-target tracking ‚Äì whereby the learned forecasting
 models help the data association step.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Human motion and behaviour in crowded spaces is influenced by 
several factors, such as the dynamics of other moving agents in the 
scene, as well as the static elements that might be perceived as points 
of attraction or obstacles. In this work, we present a new model for 
human trajectory prediction which is able to take advantage of both 
human-human and human-space interactions. The future trajectory of 
humans, are generated by observing their past positions and interactions
 with the surroundings. To this end, we propose a ‚Äúcontext-aware‚Äù 
recurrent neural network LSTM model, which can learn and predict human 
motion in crowded spaces such as a sidewalk, a museum or a shopping 
mall. We evaluate our model on a public pedestrian datasets, and we 
contribute a new challenging dataset that collects videos of humans that
 navigate in a (real) crowded space such as a big museum. Results show 
that our approach can predict human trajectories better when compared to
 previous state-of-the-art forecasting models.</td>

						<td>Multiple objects (including humans) detection and tracking 
system plays an essential role in socially aware mobile robot navigation
 framework. Because, it provides an important input for the remaining 
modules of the framework. In this paper, we propose an efficient 
multiple objects detection and tracking system for mobile service robots
 in dynamic social environments using deep learning techniques. The 
proposed system consists of two steps: (1) multiple objects detection, 
and (2) multiple objects tracking. In the first step, the RGB 
image-based multiple objects detection is made use of to detect objects 
in the mobile robot's vicinity using a convolutional neural network. In 
the second stage of system, the detected objects are tracked using a 
deep simple online and realtime tracking technique. The experimental 
results indicate that, the proposed system is capable of detecting and 
tracking multiple objects including humans, providing significant 
information for the socially aware mobile robot navigation framework.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper addresses the problem of Human-Aware Navigation 
(HAN), using multi camera sensors to implement a vision-based person 
tracking system. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: a 
novel and efÔ¨Åcient Deep Learning person detection and a standardization 
of human-aware constraints. In the Ô¨Årst stage of the approach, we 
propose to cascade the Aggregate Channel Features (ACF) detector with a 
deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to achieve fast and accurate 
Pedestrian Detection (PD). Regarding the human awareness (that can be 
deÔ¨Åned as constraints associated with the robot‚Äôs motion), we use a 
mixture of asymmetric Gaussian functions, to deÔ¨Åne the cost functions 
associated to each constraint. Both methods proposed herein are 
evaluated individually to measure the impact of each of the components. 
The Ô¨Ånal solution (including both the proposed pedestrian detection and 
the human-aware constraints) is tested in a typical domestic indoor 
scenario, in four distinct experiments. The results show that the robot 
is able to cope with human-aware constraints, deÔ¨Åned after common 
proxemics and social rules.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>When humans navigate a crowed space such as a university 
campus or the sidewalks of a busy street, they follow common sense rules
 based on social etiquette. In this paper, we argue that in order to 
enable the design of new algorithms that can take fully advantage of 
these rules to better solve tasks such as target tracking or trajectory 
forecasting, we need to have access to better data in the first place. 
To that end, we contribute the very first large scale dataset (to the 
best of our knowledge) that collects images and videos of various types 
of targets (not just pedestrians, but also bikers, skateboarders, cars, 
buses, golf carts) that navigate in a real-world outdoor environment 
such as a university campus. We present an extensive evaluation where 
different methods for trajectory forecasting are evaluated and compared.
 Moreover, we present a new algorithm for trajectory prediction that 
exploits the complexity of our new dataset and allows to: i) incorporate
 inter-class interactions into trajectory prediction models (e.g, 
pedestrian vs bike) as opposed to just intra-class interactions (e.g., 
pedestrian vs pedestrian); ii) model the degree to which the social 
forces are regulating an interaction. We call the latter "social 
sensitivity"and it captures the sensitivity to which a target is 
responding to a certain interaction. An extensive experimental 
evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our novel approach.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>We present a novel approach for trafÔ¨Åc forecasting in urban 
trafÔ¨Åc scenarios using a combination of spectral graph analysis and deep
 learning. We predict both the lowlevel information (future 
trajectories) as well as the high-level information (road-agent 
behavior) from the extracted trajectory of each road-agent. Our 
formulation represents the proximity between the road agents using a 
weighted dynamic geometric graph (DGG). We use a two-stream graph-LSTM 
network to perform trafÔ¨Åc forecasting using these weighted DGGs. The 
Ô¨Årst stream predicts the spatial coordinates of road-agents, while the 
second stream predicts whether a road-agent is going to exhibit 
overspeeding, underspeeding, or neutral behavior by modeling spatial 
interactions between road-agents. Additionally, we propose a new 
regularization algorithm based on spectral clustering to reduce the 
error margin in long-term prediction (3-5 seconds) and improve the 
accuracy of the predicted trajectories. Moreover, we prove a theoretical
 upper bound on the regularized prediction error. We evaluate our 
approach on the Argoverse, Lyft, Apolloscape, and NGSIM datasets and 
highlight the beneÔ¨Åts over prior trajectory prediction methods. In 
practice, our approach reduces the average prediction error by 
approximately 75% over prior algorithms and achieves a weighted average 
accuracy of 91.2% for behavior prediction. Additionally, our spectral 
regularization improves long-term prediction by up to 70%.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Trajectory Prediction of dynamic objects is a widely studied 
topic in the field of artificial intelligence. Thanks to a large number 
of applications like predicting abnormal events, navigation system for 
the blind, etc. there have been many approaches to attempt learning 
patterns of motion directly from data using a wide variety of techniques
 ranging from hand-crafted features to sophisticated deep learning 
models for unsupervised feature learning. All these approaches have been
 limited by problems like inefficient features in the case of hand 
crafted features, large error propagation across the predicted 
trajectory and no information of static artefacts around the dynamic 
moving objects. We propose an end to end deep learning model to learn 
the motion patterns of humans using different navigational modes 
directly from data using the much popular sequence to sequence model 
coupled with a soft attention mechanism. We also propose a novel 
approach to model the static artefacts in a scene and using these to 
predict the dynamic trajectories. The proposed method, tested on 
trajectories of pedestrians, consistently outperforms previously 
proposed state of the art approaches on a variety of large scale data 
sets. We also show how our architecture can be naturally extended to 
handle multiple modes of movement (say pedestrians, skaters, bikers and 
buses) simultaneously.</td>

						<td>Understanding and predicting the intention of pedestrians is 
essential to enable autonomous vehicles and mobile robots to navigate 
crowds. This problem becomes increasingly complex when we consider the 
uncertainty and multimodality of pedestrian motion, as well as the 
implicit interactions between members of a crowd, including any response
 to a vehicle. Our approach, Probabilistic Crowd GAN, extends recent 
work in trajectory prediction, combining Recurrent Neural Networks 
(RNNs) with Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) to output probabilistic 
multimodal predictions, from which likely modal paths are found and used
 for adversarial training. We also propose the use of Graph 
Vehicle-Pedestrian Attention Network (GVAT), which models social 
interactions and allows input of a shared vehicle feature, showing that 
inclusion of this module leads to improved trajectory prediction both 
with and without the presence of a vehicle. Through evaluation on 
various datasets, we demonstrate improvements on the existing state of 
the art methods for trajectory prediction and illustrate how the true 
multimodal and uncertain nature of crowd interactions can be directly 
modelled.</td>

						<td>This paper presents a novel online framework for safe 
crowd-robot interaction based on risk-sensitive stochastic optimal 
control, wherein the risk is modeled by the entropic risk measure. The 
sampling-based model predictive control relies on mode insertion 
gradient optimization for this risk measure as well as Trajectron++, a 
state-of-the-art generative model that produces multimodal probabilistic
 trajectory forecasts for multiple interacting agents. Our modular 
approach decouples the crowd-robot interaction into learning-based 
prediction and model-based control, which is advantageous compared to 
endto-end policy learning methods in that it allows the robot‚Äôs desired 
behavior to be speciÔ¨Åed at run time. In particular, we show that the 
robot exhibits diverse interaction behavior by varying the risk 
sensitivity parameter. A simulation study and a real-world experiment 
show that the proposed online framework can accomplish safe and efÔ¨Åcient
 navigation while avoiding collisions with more than 50 humans in the 
scene.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>We develop a human movement trajectory prediction system that 
incorporates the scene information (Scene-LSTM) as well as human 
movement trajectories (Pedestrian movement LSTM) in the prediction 
process within static crowded scenes. We superimpose a two-level grid 
structure (scene is divided into grid cells each modeled by a 
scene-LSTM, which are further divided into smaller sub-grids for finer 
spatial granularity) and explore common human trajectories occurring in 
the grid cell (e.g., making a right or left turn onto sidewalks coming 
out of an alley; or standing still at bus/train stops). Two coupled LSTM
 networks, Pedestrian movement LSTMs (one per target) and the 
corresponding Scene-LSTMs (one per grid-cell) are trained simultaneously
 to predict the next movements. We show that such common path 
information greatly influences prediction of future movement. We further
 design a scene data filter that holds important non-linear movement 
information. The scene data filter allows us to select the relevant 
parts of the information from the grid cell's memory relative to a 
target's state. We evaluate and compare two versions of our method with 
the Linear and several existing LSTM-based methods on five crowded video
 sequences from the UCY [1] and ETH [2] datasets. The results show that 
our method reduces the location displacement errors compared to related 
methods and specifically about 80% reduction compared to social 
interaction methods.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Mimicking human ability to forecast future positions or 
interpret complex interactions in urban scenarios, such as streets, 
shopping malls or squares, is essential to develop socially compliant 
robots or self-driving cars. Autonomous systems may gain advantage on 
anticipating human motion to avoid collisions or to naturally behave 
alongside people. To foresee plausible trajectories, we construct an 
LSTM (long short-term memory)-based model considering three fundamental 
factors: people interactions, past observations in terms of previously 
crossed areas and semantics of surrounding space. Our model encompasses 
several pooling mechanisms to join the above elements deÔ¨Åning multiple 
tensors, namely social, navigation and semantic tensors. The network is 
tested in unstructured environments where complex paths emerge according
 to both internal (intentions) and external (other people, not 
accessible areas) motivations. As demonstrated, modeling paths unaware 
of social interactions or context information, is insufÔ¨Åcient to 
correctly predict future positions. Experimental results corroborate the
 effectiveness of the proposed framework in comparison to LSTM-based 
models for human path prediction.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Robots that navigate through human crowds need to be able to 
plan safe, efficient, and human predictable trajectories. This is a 
particularly challenging problem as it requires the robot to predict 
future human trajectories within a crowd where everyone implicitly 
cooperates with each other to avoid collisions. Previous approaches to 
human trajectory prediction have modeled the interactions between humans
 as a function of proximity. However, that is not necessarily true as 
some people in our immediate vicinity moving in the same direction might
 not be as important as other people that are further away, but that 
might collide with us in the future. In this work, we propose Social 
Attention, a novel trajectory prediction model that captures the 
relative importance of each person when navigating in the crowd, 
irrespective of their proximity. We demonstrate the performance of our 
method against a state-of-the-art approach on two publicly available 
crowd datasets and analyze the trained attention model to gain a better 
understanding of which surrounding agents humans attend to, when 
navigating in a crowd.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Understanding human motion behavior is critical for autonomous
 moving platforms (like self-driving cars and social robots) if they are
 to navigate human-centric environments. This is challenging because 
human motion is inherently multimodal: given a history of human motion 
paths, there are many socially plausible ways that people could move in 
the future. We tackle this problem by combining tools from sequence 
prediction and generative adversarial networks: a recurrent 
sequence-to-sequence model observes motion histories and predicts future
 behavior, using a novel pooling mechanism to aggregate information 
across people. We predict socially plausible futures by training 
adversarially against a recurrent discriminator, and encourage diverse 
predictions with a novel variety loss. Through experiments on several 
datasets we demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior work in 
terms of accuracy, variety, collision avoidance, and computational 
complexity.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Pedestrians follow different trajectories to avoid obstacles 
and accommodate fellow pedestrians. Any autonomous vehicle navigating 
such a scene should be able to foresee the future positions of 
pedestrians and accordingly adjust its path to avoid collisions. This 
problem of trajectory prediction can be viewed as a sequence generation 
task, where we are interested in predicting the future trajectory of 
people based on their past positions. Following the recent success of 
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models for sequence prediction tasks, we 
propose an LSTM model which can learn general human movement and predict
 their future trajectories. This is in contrast to traditional 
approaches which use hand-crafted functions such as Social forces. We 
demonstrate the performance of our method on several public datasets. 
Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on some of these datasets
 . We also analyze the trajectories predicted by our model to 
demonstrate the motion behaviour learned by our model.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Crowd behavior understanding is crucial yet challenging across
 a wide range of applications, since crowd behavior is inherently 
determined by a sequential decision-making process based on various 
factors, such as the pedestrians' own destinations, interaction with 
nearby pedestrians and anticipation of upcoming events. In this paper, 
we propose a novel framework of Social-Aware Generative Adversarial 
Imitation Learning (SA-GAIL) to mimic the underlying decision-making 
process of pedestrians in crowds. Specifically, we infer the latent 
factors of human decision-making process in an unsupervised manner by 
extending the Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning framework to 
anticipate future paths of pedestrians. Different factors of human 
decision making are disentangled with mutual information maximization, 
with the process modeled by collision avoidance regularization and 
Social-Aware LSTMs. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of 
our framework in disentangling the latent decision-making factors of 
pedestrians and stronger abilities in predicting future trajectories.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Object tracking typically relies on a dynamic model to predict
 the object‚Äôs location from its past trajectory. In crowded scenarios a 
strong dynamic model is particularly important, because more accurate 
predictions allow for smaller search regions, which greatly simplifies 
data association. Traditional dynamic models predict the location for 
each target solely based on its own history, without tak-ing into 
account the remaining scene objects. Collisions are resolved only when 
they happen. Such an approach ignores important aspects of human 
behavior: people are driven by their future destination, take into 
account their environment, anticipate collisions, and adjust their 
trajec-tories at an early stage in order to avoid them. In this work, we
 introduce a model of dynamic social behavior, inspired by models 
developed for crowd simulation. The model is trained with videos 
recorded from birds-eye view at busy locations, and applied as a motion 
model for multi-people tracking from a vehicle-mounted camera. 
Experiments on real sequences show that accounting for social 
interactions and scene knowledge improves tracking performance, 
especially during occlusions.</td>
