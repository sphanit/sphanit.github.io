I am a Postdoctoral researcher at [LAAS-CNRS](https://www.laas.fr/public/), currently working on the [euROBIN project](https://www.eurobin-project.eu/). My primary areas of research are human-robot interaction and motion planning. I have been exploring the field of human-aware social robot navigation during my Ph.D. at LAAS and contributed to the development of an open-source human-aware navigation stack. Prior to [LAAS-CNRS](https://www.laas.fr/public/), I worked closely with humanoid robots during my Masters at [IIIT-Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), where I worked on planning stable manipulation trajectories based on reinforcement learning. I have always been an active member of the robotics club and participated in competitions during my Bachelors at [IIIT-Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) and it kindled my interest to pursue the field of robotics and their interactions with humans further.
