I am a Postdoctoral researcher at [LAAS-CNRS](https://www.laas.fr/public/) and my expertise lies in the fields of human-robot interaction and motion planning. Currently, I am contributing my knowledge and skills to the [euROBIN project](https://www.eurobin-project.eu/), which focuses on providing better softwares for human-robot interaction.

During my Ph.D. at LAAS, I had the opportunity to delve deeper into the field of human-aware social robot navigation and was involved in the development of an open-source human-aware navigation stack. Before that, during my Masters at [IIIT-Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), I worked closely with humanoid robots, where I explored planning stable manipulation trajectories based on reinforcement learning.

My interest in robotics was kindled during my Bachelors at [IIIT-Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), where I was an active member of the robotics club and participated in various competitions. Since then, I have been passionately pursuing my interest in the field of robotics and their interactions with humans.
